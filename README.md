# Lab6-exercises
This folder contains a simple python program.

## What It Does
The program prompts the user to enter two integer values and then it computes the values and prints out the values of Addition, Subtraction and Product values of the two integers.

## How To Use It
Install this program by opening the code file and copying and pasting the code into Jupyter Hub or some other kind of text editor then run the code. Next, the code with ask you for two inputs. Enter these inputs into the text box that appears when you run it. Then the program will output the addition, subtraction, and product values of the two integers. If the program products the expected output (see outputexample.txt for more details) then you have succesfully installed and run the program.

## Documentation
This program uses user input to perform its function. These prompts should appear in the code as shown:
`firstInt = int(input('Enter your first integer number '))`
`secondInt = int(input('Enter your second integer number '))`

The output is produced with the following code:
`print("Sum of two integers",sum)`
`print("Subtraction of two integers",subtraction)`
`print("Product of two integers",mult)`

See the Something.ipynb file and outputexample.txt file for more information.
